# Rafa's VIM

Kinda like VIM.

Built by Rafa, built for Rafa.

# Moving around

## 👋 Quiting

We don't want anyone getting stuck in an application they can't leave!
Any of these will send you back to your shell:

- `ctrl+c` or `ctrl+d` anywhere
- `q` while not in insert mode

## ⇵ Cursor Movement

- VIM keys ( h j k l )
- Arrows ( ← ↓ ↑ → )
- Repeat with number + navigation command
  - Eg.: `3j` to move two lines down or `15→` to move 15 columns right
